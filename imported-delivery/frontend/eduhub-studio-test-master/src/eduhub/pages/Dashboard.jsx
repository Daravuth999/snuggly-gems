// Dashboard.jsx — public landing (/).
//
// Home Dashboard V4 — Phase 3 reconstruction (flat, mobile-first, matches
// the approved mockup). Replaces the V3 "One Floating Learning World"
// (DashboardWorld/ZoneRaft/GlassPane — one continuous dark ambient canvas)
// with a plain stacked-card layout, per the approved Dashboard
// Reconstruction Blueprint §2: the ambient world and the mockup's flat
// light cards are different rendering models, not restyle variants of
// each other, so this is the one deliberate "replace" in the whole
// reconstruction. `components/dashboard/world/` is left on disk unused
// (same rollback-safety convention this codebase already uses for
// HomeTodayZone.jsx). Note: the V3-era `DashboardEnvironmentStudio.jsx`
// Author Studio panel (which had rendered `EnvironmentCanvas` directly,
// independent of this page) was already removed from master by a revert
// predating this project — its absence is unrelated to this reconstruction.
//
// PRESENTATION-ONLY reconstruction: every data source is the exact hook
// it was before (useDashboardBootstrap, useAttendance, useAuth,
// usePushNotifications, the Experience Config Platform). Two components
// this page used to render directly — Hero.jsx and TopEarnerPanel.jsx —
// are LEFT UNTOUCHED because Author Studio's WelcomeExperienceStudio and
// AchievementExperienceStudio import them directly for live preview;
// restyling them in place would silently change Author Studio's own UI,
// which is out of scope here. New sibling components (MissionHero,
// MyRankCard) read the identical resolved config/hook data instead.
//
// "Today's Discovery" (DiscoveryCard.jsx) is a NEW `daily_discovery`
// experienceType on the existing Experience Config Platform — required
// zero platform changes (an unregistered type already falls back to the
// generic empty default, same as `promotional_banner`). It renders
// nothing until a real config is published; Author Studio has no panel
// for it yet (explicitly scoped as the next Dashboard-related task).
//
// "Recent Achievements" (RecentAchievements.jsx) reuses the SAME
// useNotifications() feed LiveActivityStrip/CathyAssistant already read,
// filtered to the notification system's existing `priority==="achievement"`
// value (already a first-class field, already styled in activityTheme.js)
// — not a new subsystem. Whether the backend ever actually emits that
// priority could not be verified from this frontend-only repo; the
// component simply renders nothing if it never does, same as every other
// real-data-only widget here.
//
// Still NOT present: a live "N students studying now" count — no such
// capability is verified to exist anywhere in this codebase or its
// (inaccessible-from-here) backend, and nothing analogous to extend.
//
// LottieTileGrid / LibraryShowcase are retired from THIS page only (their
// routes remain fully reachable via the bottom nav + Sidebar, unchanged);
// both files are left on disk, unused, for rollback safety.
