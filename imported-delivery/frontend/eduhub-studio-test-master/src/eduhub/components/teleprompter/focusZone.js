// TeleprompterSettings slider (config.scrollSpeed, 0.5-2.0 — confirmed by
// reading TeleprompterSettings.jsx directly, where scrollSpeed≈1.0 is
// literally labeled "Center") used to place the active line 33-67% down
// the viewport, putting real vertical distance between the video above
// it and the line a student is trying to read. STANDARD_ANCHOR_SCALE
// uniformly compresses the SAME formula's output toward the top — same
// input, same monotonic direction, same relative Low->Center->Leading
// feel for anyone who has already tuned this setting — so the three
// options still order the same way, just all now land just below the
// video frame instead of partway down the page. 0.26 was chosen so the
// existing default (scrollSpeed=1.0, "Center") moves from 50% down to
// ~13% down. STANDARD_ANCHOR_MIN_PX keeps the anchor clear of
