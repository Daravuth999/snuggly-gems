 * NOT Hero-specific. Any experience (Welcome Dashboard, Digital Books hero,
 * Speaking Lab landing, achievement celebrations, seasonal campaigns, ...)

 * copy-pasted per feature.
 *
 * Adding a new palette/scale value here never requires touching a
 * component — components read tokens by key, they never hardcode colors.

// ── Palettes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// an accent, and a soft/glow color for typography and particles. New
// experiences pick a palette by id; they don't invent new hex values.

    label: "Morning Emerald",
    base: ["#0E1F18", "#134B34", "#1E6948"],

    accent: "#D9B872",       // champagne gold
    bloom: "#28C74F",
    softGlow: "#DFFFE9",     // warm white/green halo
    onBase: "#FFFFFF",
    onBaseSoft: "rgba(255,255,255,0.70)",
  },
  auroraNight: {
    // The pre-existing RGB/aurora look, preserved as a named palette (not
    // deleted) so any experience that still wants it can reference it —
    // nothing about the old visual language is lost, only made optional.
    label: "Aurora Night",

// ── Section rhythm (rem) — Dashboard Foundation Phase 1. Named vertical
// gaps a zone wrapper uses BETWEEN its children (never a child's own
// margin) so scrolling reads as intentional beats instead of uniform
// stacking. `tight` groups closely-related content (e.g. Hero -> the
// promotion that visually continues beneath it); `primary` is the default
// gap between adjacent sections in the same zone; `pause` is a deliberate
// breathing pause before a new content group starts (e.g. before an
// Achievement-tier section).
export const sectionRhythm = {
  tight: spacing.md,
  // RC3 §9 — Mobile-First Spacing: `primary` tightened from spacing.xl
  // (2rem/32px) to spacing.lg (1.5rem/24px). The Dashboard grew from 6 to
  // 8 top-level sections across RC2.5/RC2.9/RC3, so the SAME per-gap value
  // now compounds into noticeably more total scroll distance; a smaller
  // gap keeps sections visually distinct (still clearly more than `tight`)
  // while meaningfully reducing one-handed scroll length on a phone.
  primary: spacing.lg,
  // Campaign Design Studio 2.0 rhythm pass: the pre-Achievement breathing
  // pause was a full 3rem (xxl), which read as a disconnect between the
  // Activity group and the Leaderboard. 2.5rem (xl + sm) keeps a beat that
  // is still clearly larger than `primary` while pulling the zones into one
  // continuous premium flow.

//   Level 1 soft       — ordinary containers
//   Level 2 raised      — featured cards
//   Level 3 floating     — floating controls (chips, pills, FABs)

// reads as a real step above its own card titles/body copy instead of
// sharing the exact same size as everything beneath it. Every Dashboard
// section header (Learning Progress, Recent Achievements, Activity,
// Today's Discovery, Continue Learning) used to render the literal same
// `text-[1rem]` class as each other and nearly the same as their own card
// titles — this ladder gives each level real, distinct weight.
