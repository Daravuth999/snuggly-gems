"""
lucky_draw.py — Speaking Lab Lucky Draw season-long prize pool.

ADDITIVE ONLY. This module exposes:

  • register_lucky_draw_routes(api, db, sl_publish, gas_url, treasury_id,
                               treasury_password, *, log=None, mock_gas=False,
                               require_admin=None)
        Mounts 4 new endpoints on the existing `api` router:
            POST /api/speaking-lab/sessions/{id}/pool-entry
            GET  /api/speaking-lab/sessions/{id}/pool
            POST /api/speaking-lab/sessions/{id}/lucky-draw
            GET  /api/speaking-lab/sessions/{id}/lucky-codes

  • generate_and_publish_lucky_code(db, sl_publish, session_id, student_id,
                                    display_name, *, amount=0, log=None)
        Generate a unique 4-char lucky code for this (session_id, student_id),
        persist it, and broadcast TWO SSE events:
            • {type: "lucky_code", student_id, display_name, code,
               entry_fee, pool_total, player_count}
            • {type: "pool_update", pool_total, player_count}
        Idempotent — re-calling for the same (session_id, student_id) returns
        the existing code without double-counting the pool.

NO existing function in server.py is modified. The integration points are:
   1. Add `from lucky_draw import register_lucky_draw_routes,
                                   generate_and_publish_lucky_code`
      to server.py imports.
   2. Right before `app.include_router(api)`, call
      `register_lucky_draw_routes(api, db, _sl_publish, GAS_POINTS_LOGIN_URL,
       SL_TREASURY_ID, SL_TREASURY_PASSWORD,
       log=log, require_admin=require_admin)`.
   3. Inside `_sl_try_auto_enter`, immediately after the existing
      `await _sl_publish(session_id, {"type": "entry", ...})` line, add:
        `await generate_and_publish_lucky_code(db, _sl_publish,
            session_id, sender_id, display_name, amount=amount, log=log)`

That's it. All persisted state lives in two new Mongo collections:
   • speaking_lab_lucky_codes   { session_id, student_id, code, display_name,
                                  entry_fee, awarded_at }
   • speaking_lab_lucky_draws   audit row of each draw

GAS calls
---------
For each winner we call GAS sendPoints(treasury -> winner) using the same
shape as `sl_grant_points` in server.py. Pass `mock_gas=True` (or set env
LUCKY_DRAW_MOCK_GAS=1) to skip the GAS call and simulate success — used in
local dev / tests.

Weighted draw
-------------
Players who were NEVER picked by the slot machine during the session get a
2× weight (the "smart diversity" rule). The slot-picked set comes from the
session document's "slot_picks" field if present, otherwise no penalty
applies.  Pool is split per the session's settings doc.

Funding-source migration (architecture continuation — "students no longer
contribute points to the pool through entry fees; administrators fund the
pool through the Prize Pool Platform")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTHING about lucky-code issuance, attendance, eligibility, the draw
state machine, GAS payout, or the atomic claims above changed. The ONLY
thing that changed is where `pool_total` (the number split among
winners) comes from:

  * Legacy sessions (no `prize_pool_id` on the session doc) — UNCHANGED,
    `pool_total` is still the sum of `entry_fee` across
    `speaking_lab_lucky_codes` rows, exactly as before this migration.
  * A session an admin has linked to a Prize Pool via
    `prize_pool.link_pool_to_session` — `pool_total` is that pool's LIVE
    balance instead (see `_resolve_pool_total`). Students still receive
    lucky codes exactly as before; `entry_fee` on those codes is simply
    0 under this model (nobody pays), so the legacy entry-fee sum would
    have been 0 anyway — this is what makes the swap backward compatible
    rather than a parallel/duplicate mechanism.

After a paid finalize, `_record_pool_distribution` best-effort records
each winner's payout in the LINKED pool's own ledger (via
`prize_pool.distribute`) so Author Studio's "remaining balance" and
"distribution history" reflect reality — this NEVER touches
`_finalize_draw`'s own GAS transfer / per-winner atomic claims; it only
reads their already-committed result and records a parallel ledger
entry, wired at the two callers (this module's own finalize routes, and
event_engine.py's `_finalize_lucky_draw` wrapper), never inside
`_finalize_draw` itself.
