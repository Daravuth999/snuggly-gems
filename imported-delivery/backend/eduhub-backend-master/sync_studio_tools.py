"""sync_studio_tools.py — Universal Synchronization Engine, Mongo-backed
routes (Phase 0 foundation + native media upload).

Implements the storage strategy and API contracts from
docs/proposals/universal-synchronization-engine-technical-spec.md §9/§10 in
the frontend repo. Collection: `chapter_sync`, owned exclusively by this
module (registered in tools/check_collection_ownership.py's
OWNED_COLLECTIONS) — primary-keyed by `syncId` per the schema's Media
Independence principle (spec §4): a sync document's identity is the media
asset, not a book/chapter. `slug`/`chapterIndex`/`blockIndex` on the stored
Mongo document are a STORAGE-LAYER convenience binding (secondary index for
"what does this chapter currently point to") — they are NOT part of the
canonical schema itself (sync_schema.py never mentions a book or chapter).

Two ways a sync document is created, both implemented here:
  1. `create_sync_from_chapter_block` — backfills from ALREADY-GENERATED
     ElevenLabs `wordTimestamps` (the "thin adapter at read time" spec §11
     describes). No new provider call.
  2. `create_sync_from_upload` — a NATIVE audio/video upload from an admin.
     Stores the real media (R2-first, GridFS-fallback, same
     graceful-degradation discipline as server.py's `_upload_audio_to_r2` —
     never hero_artwork_tools.py's R2-or-nothing pattern, which this
     project's own architecture study flags as a real risk for new media
     types) and creates a sync document with `alignmentStatus:
     "awaiting_provider"`. NO Speech Recognition/Alignment provider is
     called here — that vendor is deliberately not yet chosen (tech spec
     §12); this is honest, complete infrastructure work that does not wait
     on that decision, per the explicit "continue provider-neutral
     implementation" instruction it was built under.

Review-workflow scope, deliberately: `reviewStatus` transitions and speaker
relabeling are implemented and tested. Transcript-text editing with
nearest-neighbor word-boundary re-keying (spec §5) is NOT implemented in
this pass — it is real Review Studio UI/algorithm work for a follow-up
commit, not something to fake here. `editedTranscript` in the review
payload is accepted and stored as a pending note only.

IMPORTANT (Python 3.14 FastAPI multipart fix): `UploadFile`/`File`/`Form`
are imported at MODULE level below, not inside `register_sync_studio_
routes`. A prior incident in this codebase confirmed that importing them
lazily inside a sibling module's registration function causes a per-request
500 under Python 3.14's stricter ForwardRef resolution — hero_artwork_
tools.py (this repo's only other multipart-upload sibling module) already
established the module-level-import fix; this module follows the same
pattern.

    any failure (env vars absent, boto3 missing, network error) so the

    hero_artwork_tools.py's R2-or-nothing pattern — this project's own
    architecture study (§8, Risks) flags that pattern as a real failure
    mode for a future media pipeline without a GridFS-style fallback.

    2026-09 — `key` is now content-addressed (sha256 of the raw bytes,
    see create_sync_from_upload) rather than a random UUID, so this
    HEAD-checks the key first and skips the PUT entirely when that exact
    content is already stored — the SAME dedup pattern already proven in
    assessment_tools.py's `_upload_media_to_r2` (never shared/imported
    across modules, per this codebase's own R2-client-per-module
    isolation convention — see that module's identical HEAD-then-PUT
    structure).

    2026-09 (large-upload OOM fix) — `file_path`, when given, streams the
    PUT body directly from that file instead of requiring the caller to
    pass the whole thing as `raw: bytes` (pass `raw=None` in that case).
    boto3's `put_object` accepts a seekable file object for `Body` and
    reads it in chunks itself; this is what lets create_sync_from_upload
    upload a remuxed video straight from the temp file remux_faststart_
    to_file produced, without ever holding a second full in-memory copy of
    a large file alongside the original upload buffer — see that
    function's docstring for the confirmed production OOM this fixes.
    Exactly one of `raw`/`file_path` should be given; existing callers are
    unaffected — they keep passing `raw` and never set `file_path`.

    `endpoint_override` exists ONLY for tests — no production call site
    ever passes it, so real behavior (the actual R2 endpoint below) is
    unchanged. It lets tests point the exact same boto3 client construction
    and put_object call at a local S3-compatible mock server instead of
    mocking this function away entirely, so the real request contract
    (signing, bucket/key, content-type, metadata) is genuinely exercised."""

    No Speech Recognition/Alignment provider is called here. This is a
    complete, real, useful unit on its own: the media is genuinely stored

    `slug`/`chapter_index` are the Books-specific binding (optional — Media
    Independence, spec §4: a sync document's identity is the media asset,
    not any particular owner). `owner_ref` is a free-form alternative

    `f"video_lesson:{lesson_id}"`) so OTHER products can reuse this exact
    storage/schema path without this module knowing anything about videos —
    it only ever stores whatever reference string the caller gives it.

    2026-09 (Video Factory surgical bug-fix pass, §2e/4e + §2c/4b):
      - The storage key is now content-addressed — sha256 of the ORIGINAL
        uploaded bytes — instead of a random UUID, so retrying an upload
        (or an admin re-submitting the identical file after an unclear
        pipeline step) can never create a duplicate, permanent storage
        object; it just re-resolves to whatever is already there. `raw`
        is hashed BEFORE any remux, so dedup stays stable even if the
        ffmpeg version changes between deploys — only the stored bytes
        benefit from the remux below, never the dedup key.
      - A video upload is passed through video_render_tools.
        remux_faststart first (best-effort, never blocks): relocates the
        MP4 moov atom to the front so playback duration/seeking resolves
        immediately instead of requiring the whole file to download first
        — the same zero-risk fix already proven for the AI-narration
        master, now applied to the original video every student actually
        watches by default.

    2026-09 (real production incident fix — a 164.7MB video upload
    crashed the server with "Network error during upload"; Render's own
    restart banner appeared ~12s after ffmpeg's remux completed,
    consistent with an OOM kill): CONFIRMED via direct reproduction of
    this exact function's code path against a real ~175MB video — process
    RSS went from ~204MB (after the initial full-buffer read, which
    happens upstream in the route before this function is ever called) to
    ~379MB right after the remux step, because remux_faststart used to
    read the whole remuxed output back into a SECOND full-size `bytes`
    object that then coexisted with the original `raw` for the rest of
    this function, including the slow, network-bound upload to storage.
    Fix: stream the remuxed output from disk (video_render_tools.
    remux_faststart_to_file, deleted here once the upload finishes)
    instead of materializing it as a second in-memory buffer — peak
    memory for this function is now back to ~1x the file size (the
    original buffer alone) instead of ~2x, for the exact same reason a
    plain audio upload (never remuxed) never had this problem. The sha256
    hash is now computed off the event loop (a real, separately-confirmed
    ~0.5s-per-175MB blocking call previously ran directly on it) — a
    small, low-risk fix for the same investigation, not a memory fix."""

# ── storage-lifecycle cleanup (2026-09, Video Factory surgical bug-fix
#    pass, §2e/4e) — content-hash dedup above means a `mediaRef` can now
#    legitimately be shared by more than one chapter_sync/video_lessons
#    document, so these three helpers exist to make the OTHER half of
#    dedup safe: never delete a storage object a real document still
#    references, matching assessment_tools.py's own best-effort/log-
#    critical/never-block delete discipline (never shared/imported across
#    modules, per this codebase's own R2-client-per-module isolation
#    convention — the underlying delete call is duplicated, not reused).
#
#    Ownership discipline (tools/check_collection_ownership.py): this
#    module owns `chapter_sync` exclusively. It therefore exposes a
#    delete + a reference-check over that ONE collection; a caller that
#    also owns another collection referencing the same mediaRef (e.g.
#    video_library_tools.py's `video_lessons`) is responsible for
#    checking its OWN collection itself before deciding the object is
#    genuinely orphaned — this module never reaches into another
#    module's collection to do that for it. ──────────────────────────────
