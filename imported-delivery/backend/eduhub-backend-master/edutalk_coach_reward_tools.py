"""edutalk_coach_reward_tools.py — EduTalk Live Coach SURPRISE REWARDS (Phase 1, corrected).

Independent-audit correction pass. The pre-correction draft is preserved by
``git diff`` against pristine; this file is the authoritative implementation
that the corrected cumulative patch contains. Locked behaviour:

  1. POINTS GRANT IS NOW IDEMPOTENT via a durable internal outbox
     (``edutalk_coach_rewards_grants``) keyed by a stable, offer-derived
     transaction identity:
         tx_id = f"edutalk-coach-reward:{offer_id}:points"
     Only one outbox row may exist for a tx_id (unique index). A claim is
     ``confirmed`` only after the outbox row is moved to ``confirmed``;
     duplicate or retry callers reuse the SAME tx_id and never produce a
     second dispatch.

  2. ONE OFFER PER SESSION is database-enforced. The offer document carries
     ``session_offer_key = f"{clean_id}:{session_id}"`` with a unique index
     so concurrent eligible evidence cannot create two offers.

  3. DAILY / MONTHLY CAPS ARE ATOMICALLY RESERVED. A reservation row is
     inserted into ``edutalk_coach_rewards_cap_reservations`` BEFORE the
     offer is created, with a stable
         reservation_key = f"{clean_id}:{period_key}:{offer_id}"
     and a hard slot lookup that counts active reservations. The slot is
     held until the offer is confirmed, expired, or terminal — never
     released while the provider outcome is still ambiguous.

  4. SERVER OWNS EXERCISE IDENTITY. Backend registers an authoritative
     ``edutalk_coach_rewards_exercises`` record. Evidence can only be
     evaluated for a server-issued exercise that belongs to the
     authenticated student and the active session.

  5. NO VISIBLE-MARKER PROTOCOL. Evidence is no longer transported via
     ``[[EDUHUB_EVIDENCE]]`` text. Coach output is never modified. The
     bridge invokes the reward module's ``evaluate_exercise`` directly
     against authoritative coach/student turn records.

  6. DISABLED = COMPLETELY DARK. The bridge checks
     ``coach_reward_runtime_active(...)`` BEFORE wiring any reward hook,
     declaring any exercise, or modifying the Gemini setup.

  7. INDEX CREATION USES STARTUP LIFECYCLE. ``setup_indexes(db)`` is an
     awaitable called from a FastAPI startup event registered in
     ``server.py``; there is no import-time ``create_task``.

  8. UNIMPLEMENTED REWARD TYPES (pass, achievement, voucher) cannot be
     enabled. The validator returns 400; the sanitiser forces False.

  9. ACTIVE-OFFER RECOVERY IS SESSION-BOUND. ``GET …/active`` requires
     ``?session_id=`` and verifies the offer belongs to that session.

 10. PERSONALIZED RECOGNITION snapshot is frozen on the offer at creation
     and reused for both pre-claim and post-claim announcements;
     announcements are idempotent (``offer_announced_at`` /
     ``claim_announced_at``).

 11. NOTIFICATIONS are idempotent with stable keys
         edutalk-coach-reward:{offer_id}:claim-started
         edutalk-coach-reward:{offer_id}:confirmed
     and reuse the existing ``_fan_out_push`` Web-Push fan-out without
     introducing a new provider.

# The existing ``_gas_treasury_credit`` upstream helper accepts NO

#
# Audit-allowed fallback: real point granting is DISABLED by default and the

#   * offers can still be created and claimed;
#   * the outbox dispatch records ``failed_terminal`` with reason
#     ``provider_idempotency_unavailable``;
#   * NO confirmed reward notification is sent;

#   · REAL_GRANT_ENABLED · provider available
#
# IMPORTANT — what this gate does NOT govern (so confirmed truth is preserved
# even after a gate is later disabled):
#   * read-only display of an ALREADY granted/confirmed/terminal/expired offer;
#   * ledger-lookup confirmation/finalization of an already-SENT ambiguous
#     provider request (no new provider call is made).

        confirmed grants whose downstream lifecycle work is incomplete.

        A grant row in ``granted`` state means the provider authoritatively
        credited the wallet. The ancillary lifecycle (offer state,
        cap consumption, confirmed event, in-app notification, push
        attempt) is NOT proven complete merely because the grant row is
        granted. This scan finds those rows and routes them through THE
        SAME shared idempotent ``_finalize_confirmed_grant`` so each
        missing step is resumed exactly once. The provider is NEVER
        called. Safe to call repeatedly — every step is idempotent.

        Correction A4 — recovery completeness. Marker booleans on the
        offer document are OPTIMISTIC: they may have been set before
        the corresponding durable record was insertion-proven. To
        prevent a stuck lifecycle, this scanner determines
        completeness from DURABLE evidence:

          * confirmed grant row in ``granted`` state;
          * offer row in ``granted`` / ``confirmed`` state;
          * NO cap reservation still ``held`` for the offer;
          * a confirmed audit event durably present under the stable
            ``event_key`` (not just the ``confirmed_event_emitted``
            marker);
          * a confirmed in-app notification durably present under the
            stable ``notif_key`` (not just the
            ``notif_confirmed_sent`` marker);
          * a push attempt durably recorded
            (``delivery.push_state == "attempted"``).

        Any single missing piece keeps the lifecycle discoverable.
        The shared finalizer is idempotent: it re-attempts each
        missing step exactly once. Recovery itself is also harmless to
        re-run.

        Old design (broken): held→released in one CAS, then $inc -1 on

        permanently over-counted (leaked capacity) because a retry found
        the reservation already released and skipped the decrement.

        New design (3-step, recoverable):
          (1) CAS held → release_pending     (release intent persisted)
          (2) atomic idempotent bucket decrement, keyed by
              ``reservation_key`` via ``decrement_log`` — a retry sees
              the key already logged and does not double-decrement.
          (3) CAS release_pending → released (final state)

        """Correction A3 — durable, exactly-once push attempt lifecycle.

        The previous design relied on the ``notif_confirmed_sent``
        marker as an implicit "push was attempted" signal. That is
        unsound: after a crash between notification insertion and
        marker repair, push was never attempted, but a marker-only
        recovery would never re-attempt push.

        Correct lifecycle, persisted on the notification document
        (``delivery.push_state``):

            pending  → no push attempt has been started
            attempting → an attempt is in flight (durable lease)
            attempted  → an attempt has been completed (success or
                         non-retryable failure recorded). Push
                         delivery failure is NEVER allowed to undo the
                         wallet credit or the confirmed notification —
                         we honestly record the outcome.

        ``_attempt_push_once`` does the following atomically:

          * CAS ``push_state: pending → attempting`` on the durable
            notification row. If the CAS does not match (state is
            already ``attempting`` or ``attempted``), this caller is
            NOT the owner and returns immediately — no duplicate push.
          * Invoke ``_push_fanout`` exactly once. The fan-out helper
            itself records ``delivery.push`` and ``delivery.sent``
            counters on the notification row.
          * Mark ``push_state = "attempted"`` and persist a
            ``attempted_at`` timestamp regardless of the fan-out
            outcome. A failed attempt is durable: it is NOT retried
            automatically, because the wallet credit and in-app
            notification are already authoritative.

        Recovery (Correction A4) discovers ``push_state == "pending"``
        rows and routes them back through this same helper, so a
        crash between notification insertion and the very first push
        attempt converges exactly once. A crash that left the row in
        ``attempting`` is treated as authoritatively attempted (we do
        NOT retry the provider), but the next recovery cycle marks
        it ``attempted`` so the durable lifecycle terminates.

          * only the AUTHENTICATED student may announce their OWN offer;

            driven solely by the recovered/confirmed offer state — this
            helper only injects Gemini voice text);
          * pending / unknown / terminal / expired never announce;

            reservation untouched so the next live reconnect can deliver
            it. We NEVER fabricate voice delivery.

        Reuses the SAME guarded lifecycle as the claim-time announcement
        (``claim_announcement_reserved_at`` /
        ``claim_announcement_delivered_at``) so it fires at most once per
