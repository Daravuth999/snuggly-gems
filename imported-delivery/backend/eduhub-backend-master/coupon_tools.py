# ===========================================================================
# Coupon System — v1.0 (moved out of server.py, Architecture Reconstruction
# Phase 1f — "server.py partial router split, proof-of-pattern")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the FIRST of a deliberately small, bounded slice of server.py's own
# inline @api.* routes extracted into a per-domain module, matching the
# register_*_routes(api, db, ...) explicit-DI convention already used for
# every previously-exec()'d module (Phase 1b/1c). It is not a claim that the
# whole ~7800-line server.py has been decomposed — see server.py's own
# comment at the old location for the current extraction scope.
#
# Behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to the original inline routes: same
# collection (``coupons``), same validation, same response shapes, same
# helper functions. Nothing about the coupon system's logic changed — only
# where the code lives.
#
# Registered via register_coupon_routes(api, db, require_admin, User) from
# server.py. Returns ``_generate_coupon_code`` because login_reward_tools.py's
# own registration call passes it in as its shared code-generator (see
# server.py's login_reward_tools wiring) — every other helper here
# (_calc_discount, _find_valid_coupon) is purely internal to this module's
# own routes and is not consumed anywhere else (edutalk_coupon_tools.py reads
# the same ``coupons`` collection directly with its own separate fields and
# never touches these helpers, per its own module docstring).
#
# Collections: coupons

# Public-promotion redemption ledger — deliberately a SEPARATE, standalone
# collection (never embedded inside a coupon doc's own `redemptions` array)
# so a promotion's "has this student already redeemed it" history survives
# an admin deleting/rotating the individual coupon CODE that was used. A
# coupon doc's own redemptions array is scoped to that one code; a public
# promotion (e.g. "the ongoing 100%-off launch offer") may be represented by
# several rotated codes over time sharing one `promotion_id` — the code
# itself is disposable, the promotion identity is not. Unique index on
# (promotion_id, student_id) — see server.py startup() — is what actually
# enforces "at most one successful redemption per user per promotion",
# race-proof against concurrent requests (see redeem_coupon below).

        CRITICAL CORRECTION (see git history): the previous implementation
        made this protection entirely opt-in — an admin had to manually
        set promotion_id on a coupon, and it silently did nothing on any
        coupon that predated the field or where the admin simply never
        touched it. A public 100%-off coupon with that field unset gave
        every student unlimited free books (redeem the same code once per
        book) — reproduced end to end in this file's own tests before this
        fix.

        Now: an admin-set promotion_id always wins (explicit grouping of
        several rotated codes under one shared limit — unchanged from
        before). When none is set, a coupon that is BOTH public
        (assigned_to is empty — anyone can redeem it) AND a full 100%
        discount (type == "percent", value >= 100) is AUTOMATICALLY
        treated as its own one-code promotion, keyed on its own code —
        zero admin action required. This is deliberately narrow: a
        partial-discount or student-assigned coupon is never auto-limited,
        since an admin may legitimately want a reusable discount code
        (e.g. "SAVE20" usable by the same student across many books) — only
        a coupon that gives a book away for free, to anyone, is inherently
        the one-time promotional-freebie shape this limit protects against.
        A fixed-amount ("pts off") coupon is never auto-included either —
        whether it happens to cover 100% of a given book's price is
        price-dependent, not a static, unambiguous coupon property.
