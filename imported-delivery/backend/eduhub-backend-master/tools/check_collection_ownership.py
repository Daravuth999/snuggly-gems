"""tools/check_collection_ownership.py — MongoDB collection-ownership lint.

Architecture Reconstruction Phase 1e ("Collection Ownership" — "Each MongoDB
collection must have one owning module. Other modules may consume through
interfaces but should not write directly. Enforce this through architecture
and tooling where practical.").

The full backend has ~101 distinct collections and confirmed pre-existing
multi-module violations (e.g. `students` touched by 13 modules,
`points_wallets` touched by 4 despite wallet_service.py's own docstring
claiming exclusive ownership). Untangling those is real consolidation work
— a later phase, not this one. This script has two modes to match that:

  (no flags)  Report mode — lists every collection referenced by more than
              one file. Always exits 0. Informational: "here is today's
              real fan-out," not a blocking gate. Safe to run in CI as a
              visibility step.

  --strict    Enforcement mode — checks ONLY the collections in
              OWNED_COLLECTIONS below (each one a collection this Phase 1
              conversion pass gave a single, confirmed real owning module,
              by reading the code) against every file that references them.
              Fails (exit 1) if any of those collections is now touched by
              a file other than its declared owner (or the tests/ dir).
              This is a genuine, currently-passing regression gate — it
              does not require solving the pre-existing 101-collection
              problem, only guarding what Phase 1 already made clean. Grow
              OWNED_COLLECTIONS as more collections get consolidated.

Detection is a static regex scan for `db.<name>` and `db["<name>"]` /
`db['<name>']` — good enough for this codebase's actual usage (confirmed:
no dynamic `db[some_variable]` collection access patterns in the modules
this script's OWNED_COLLECTIONS covers), not a general-purpose Mongo query
analyzer.
