"""One-time, authoring-only word timing selection for Video Library.

ElevenLabs Scribe v2 is the default speech/timing authority for new runs.
It returns spoken text, measured word boundaries, speaker identities,
language, and recognition confidence in one call. Gemini remains separate
and receives the persisted Scribe transcript only for educational analysis.

The older Gemini word-timestamp implementation and generic merge helpers
remain below solely as a controlled rollback path. Set
VIDEO_ALIGNMENT_PROVIDER=gemini to select it; the default is elevenlabs.
Student playback never imports or calls this module.

2026-09 REDESIGN — GEMINI ONLY (immediately follows the previous commit's
ElevenLabs removal). Verified directly against Gemini's own official
documentation (ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/transcribe,
.../models/gemini-3.5-transcribe, ai.google.dev/api/interactions-api —
fetched live 2026-09, not assumed) before writing a line of this module,
per the explicit "do not guess which model/endpoint to use" instruction,
and additionally validated live against the real API with a real
GEMINI_API_KEY (see this round's report for the actual measured output —
19/19 words matched, real timestamps confirmed against real spoken audio):

  - gemini-3.5-transcribe is the ONLY Gemini model documented to return real,
    MEASURED per-word start/end timestamps for audio it did not itself
    generate (`generation_config.transcription_config.mode.
    timestamp_granularities: ["word"]`). Every general-purpose Gemini model
    already used elsewhere in this codebase (gemini-2.5-flash for ASR
    segmentation, gemini-3.1-pro for deep story analysis — see
    video_ai_provider.py) is NOT documented to have this capability.
  - It is reached through a DIFFERENT API surface than every other Gemini
    call in this codebase: the "Interactions API"
    (`POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions`),
    not `generateContent`. Confirmed live: request shape, response shape
    (`{"steps": [{"content": [{"annotations": [{"type": "word_info", "text",
    "start_offset": "<seconds>s", "end_offset": "<seconds>s", ...}]}]}]}`),
    header-based auth (`x-goog-api-key`, not the `?key=` query param this
    codebase's other Gemini calls use), and that audio must be supplied as a
    Files-API file `uri` — inline base64 is not accepted for this endpoint.
  - CONFIRMED GAP, stated honestly rather than papered over: nowhere in
    Gemini's own docs for this model, this endpoint, or the audio-
    transcription guide is there ANY per-word confidence/logprob field —
    confirmed against the real live response too, not just the docs.
    ElevenLabs Scribe (the removed design) exposed one; gemini-3.5-transcribe
    does not. This module therefore NEVER populates `confidence.alignment`
    with a number for a Gemini-measured word — doing so would be exactly the
    "fabricate a high confidence value" this project's own conventions (see
    sync_schema.py's own docstring) and this round's explicit instructions
    forbid. Instead, a matched word is marked `measured: True` — a plain,
    non-fabricated FACT about provenance (two independent Gemini
    transcriptions of the same audio agreed on this word), never an invented
    probability. See computeSentenceConfidenceTier in the frontend's
    Teleprompter.jsx for how the confidence-tiered rendering was updated to
    use this signal (old ElevenLabs-produced documents already in the
    database, which DO carry a real numeric `confidence.alignment`, keep
    working exactly as before — that code path was preserved, not replaced).
  - Duration limit confirmed live: word-level timestamps cap a single
    gemini-3.5-transcribe request at 30 minutes of audio (vs 1 hour without
    timestamps). Checked BEFORE spending an upload/network call on a lesson
    that would only be rejected anyway (MAX_ALIGNMENT_AUDIO_SECONDS below).
  - Cost confirmed live (ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing): ~$0.003-
    0.005/minute of audio — a one-time authoring-time cost per lesson, never
    a per-play cost (enforced structurally: see the "exactly once, never
    from playback" test in tests/test_video_word_alignment.py, unchanged
    from the removed design's proof strategy).
  - Model freshness/risk, stated plainly rather than hidden: gemini-3.5-
    transcribe and the Interactions API launched 2026-08-27, ~2 weeks before
    this module was written. Google's own developer forum has an open
    2026-09 thread about a DIFFERENT documented request shape (custom
    vocabulary + diarization) being rejected by the live API — a real signal
    this is a young, still-settling API surface. The request this module
    sends (word timestamps only, no diarization, no custom vocabulary) is
    not the combination reported broken, and was independently confirmed
    working end-to-end against the real API, but this is a genuine
    deployment risk worth monitoring, not a guaranteed-stable integration.

Preserved from the removed design, unaffected by which provider supplies the
timing data: this is still a SECOND, independent transcription of the SAME
audio Gemini's segmentation step already transcribed, merged by matching word
tokens (difflib.SequenceMatcher over normalized tokens) rather than literal
reference-conditioned forced alignment — gemini-3.5-transcribe, like
ElevenLabs Scribe before it, always performs full ASR from scratch and does
not accept a reference transcript to align against (confirmed against its
own docs: the Interactions API's `input` is the audio only, with no
transcript-conditioning parameter documented). Wherever a Gemini-segmentation
word and a Gemini-transcribe word line up as the same token, the segmentation
word's start/end is REPLACED with the transcribe pass's real, measured
timing. Any word that doesn't have a match — background noise, a second
untranscribed speaker, off-script speech, a genuine ASR disagreement between
the two passes — is left exactly as the segmentation pass's own length-
weighted interpolation produced it, never fabricated.

Gemini's sentence boundaries, speaker labels, and paragraph grouping are
NEVER touched here — only word.start/word.end/word.measured within an
EXISTING sentence structure are ever modified. This module knows nothing
about Mongo, the pipeline, or a lesson id: it takes bytes and a sync
document in, returns a sync document and a telemetry dict out, mirroring
video_render_tools.py's own "bytes in, bytes/dict out, no side effects"
discipline in this codebase.

    need this since it accepted a raw multipart file with no mime
