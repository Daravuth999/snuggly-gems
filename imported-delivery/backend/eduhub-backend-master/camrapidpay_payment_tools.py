# ===========================================================================
# CamRapidPay Points Top Up - EduHub integration tools
#
# Registered via register_camrapidpay_payment_routes(api, db, require_student,
# complete_points_payment) from server.py (normal import, explicit DI --
# matches the established register_*_routes convention; Architecture
# Reconstruction Phase 1, item 2). ``complete_points_payment`` is the
# existing proven credit path (payment_bridge._complete_points_payment)
# passed in explicitly rather than resolved via globals() lookup, so this
# module's conversion is decoupled from payment_bridge.py's own conversion
# timing. The register call returns (reconcile_once, ensure_indexes,
# verify_via_bank_notification) -- reconcile_once for server.py's existing
# 60s background loop, ensure_indexes (Phase 1e, Collection Ownership) so
# server.py's startup handler creates camrapidpay_intents' indexes via this
# owning module instead of touching the collection directly itself, and
# verify_via_bank_notification (Aug 2026 hybrid-verification restore) which
# server.py wires into payment_bridge.py's existing late_binds dict so its
# ABA/Bakong Telegram-notification bridge can offer a second, independent
# confirmation source for a CamRapidPay-created intent.
#
# SECURITY / TRUTH MODEL (non-negotiable):
#   - The webhook is a WAKE-UP TRIGGER ONLY. It never credits from its body.
#   - The ONLY proof of payment is a server-to-server CamRapidPay status call
#     returning Success -- OR (Aug 2026 hybrid-verification restore, see
#     _camrapidpay_verify_via_bank_notification below) a strictly single-
#     matched ABA/Bakong Telegram bank notification via payment_bridge.py's
#     existing bridge, used only as a second confirmation source for the
#     confirmed CamRapidPay reconciliation outage.
#   - All CamRapidPay-Success trigger paths (webhook, polling, "I've paid")
#     funnel through verify_camrapidpay_payment_and_credit_once(reference),
#     UNCHANGED. The bank-notification bridge is a separate function that
#     claims the same camrapidpay_intents document via the same atomic gate.
#   - Crediting is guarded by an ATOMIC find_one_and_update flip so two
#     racing triggers -- from either source -- can never both credit
#     (provably once, regardless of which one arrives first).
#   - Points/amount/currency come from the internal intent (source of truth),
#     never from the frontend or the webhook body.

# v1.6.1 hotfix: EMV TLV → PNG data URI
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CamRapidPay's ``qr_code`` response field returns the **raw KHQR EMV TLV
# payload string** (e.g. ``00020101021230510016abaakhppxxx@abaa...6304XXXX``)
# — NOT a base64 image or data URI. The v1.6 in-PWA checkout assumed the
# field was already an image, so the student-facing modal correctly fell
# through to "KHQR is temporarily unavailable" because the payload string
# contains characters (``@``, ``:``, etc.) that are not valid base64.
#
# This helper renders the EMV TLV text into a small (1–2 KB) PNG and
# returns a self-contained ``data:image/png;base64,...`` URI which is
# what the frontend already knows how to display. The raw ``qr_code``
# text is still returned unchanged so any other client/automation that
# was already using it continues to work.
#
# ``segno`` is a pure-Python, zero-dependency QR encoder (~120 KB on
# disk). Failure to import is non-fatal: the response simply omits
# ``qr_image`` and the frontend can fall back to its existing handling
# (or render the safe error). No money-movement logic is touched.

        TRUTH MODEL (v1.4):
          - The ONLY thing that authorizes a credit is a server-to-server
            CamRapidPay status call returning Success. Webhook body is never
            trusted for crediting OR for blocking.
          - The atomic claim filter accepts pending / paid / expired (v1.4).
            "expired" is included so a legitimately paid intent that was marked
            expired locally before provider confirmation can still be credited
            once via the atomic gate. paid_not_credited is NOT claimable because
            we cannot prove a prior attempt did not already credit at GAS
            (_complete_points_payment is NOT reference-idempotent - Blocker 4).
          - Local expiry (now > expires_at) only marks "expired" when the
            provider does NOT say Success. A late SUCCESS still credits, because
            payment really happened for our unique reference (Blocker 3).
          - Webhook mismatch is audit-only and never moves status, so it can
            never block a real Success (Blocker 1 fix - enforced in the webhook
            handler; this function ignores webhook fields entirely).

        Flow:
          1. Load intent. If already credited -> idempotent no-op.
          2. If manual_review -> return immediately (human must resolve).
          3. If crediting -> return pending (sweep handles stale case).
          4. [expired falls through - v1.4] Server-to-server status check.
          5. If Success -> atomic claim (pending|paid|expired) -> credit once.

    # Hybrid verification restore (Aug 2026 incident) — bank-notification
    # bridge, second verification source
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ROOT CAUSE (confirmed with bank receipt + CamRapidPay's own merchant
    # dashboard, both cross-checked against Render logs): CamRapidPay is not
    # a custodial processor here — KHQR settlement lands directly in our
    # linked Bakong/ABA account the instant a student pays. check-transaction
    # -api is supposed to separately confirm that settlement and report
    # Success; that reconciliation step is broken on CamRapidPay's side —
    # confirmed transactions sit in "Pending" on BOTH their API and their own
    # dashboard indefinitely (support case pending with CamRapidPay).
    #
    # This restores the hybrid resilience the ABA/manual flow already has:
    # payment_bridge.py's existing Telegram-notification bridge (proven in
    # production for ABA PayWay notifications, "via Bakong" transfers
    # included per _parse_payway_message's own payment_method capture) is
    # wired here as a SECOND, independent confirmation source for a
    # CamRapidPay-created intent — used only when CamRapidPay's own
    # check-transaction-api hasn't (yet, or ever) reported Success.
    #
    # Everything else about the money-safety model is reused, not
    # reinvented:
    #   - verify_camrapidpay_payment_and_credit_once() above is NOT modified
    #     and remains the CamRapidPay-Success path exactly as today.
    #   - This function claims the SAME camrapidpay_intents document via the
    #     SAME atomic find_one_and_update flip (status pending/paid/expired
    #     + credited_at:None -> "crediting"), so MongoDB's own atomicity is
    #     what guarantees "credited only once regardless of which source
    #     arrives first" — whichever caller's find_one_and_update reaches
    #     Mongo first wins the claim; the other sees claimed=None and safely
    #     no-ops. No new locking mechanism, no schema change to the intent
    #     model, no change to duplicate-credit protection.
    #   - Both paths converge on the exact same complete_points_payment(...)
    #     call (the same parameter both this module and payment_bridge.py
    #     have shared since Phase 1's explicit-DI conversion) — the same
    #     wallet update, the same downstream receipt/notification flow.
    #   - Strict single-match discipline mirrors payment_bridge.py's own
    #     _find_best_intent(): exact amount match, unexpired only, and an
    #     AMBIGUOUS match (more than one candidate) is never auto-credited —
    #     routed to manual_review exactly like an unknown credit outcome, so
    #     a human decides rather than the system guessing.

        intent - a retry could double-credit if GAS actually succeeded before the
