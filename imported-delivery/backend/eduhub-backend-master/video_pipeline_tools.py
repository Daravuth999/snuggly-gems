"""video_pipeline_tools.py — Video Library automatic AI processing pipeline.

Orchestrates the post-upload flow the product spec defines:

    Upload → Media Ready → Speech Recognition (Gemini, see
    video_ai_provider.py) → Synchronization Generation (canonical
    sync_schema.py document, applied via sync_studio_tools.apply_alignment_
    result — chapter_sync stays exclusively owned by sync_studio_tools) →
    Gemini Educational Analysis → Review Ready (Synchronization Review
    Studio takes over) → Author Approval → Publish.

The player NEVER performs speech recognition — everything here happens at
content-processing time, once, server-side.

Pipeline state lives ON the lesson document (`pipeline` field, owned by
video_library_tools' video_lessons collection — this module only writes it
through video_library_tools-style direct updates on the same collection
constant, matching the "pipeline is lesson production metadata" reality).
An atomic claim ($set running only when not already running) makes
concurrent runs structurally impossible, mirroring the purchase state
machine's claim discipline.

Runs as an asyncio background task (asyncio.create_task) fired by the media
upload route — this codebase is a single-process FastAPI service and every
existing long-running job (Book Factory narration, Voice Treasure image
generation) follows the same in-process pattern; no new queue infrastructure
is introduced.

# 2026-09 — startup-time orphaned-pipeline reconciliation (§2). COMPLEMENTARY
# to _pipeline_is_stale above, not a replacement: that check runs INSIDE an
# already-running process (get_pipeline_status's self-heal, triggered by the
# Studio's ~2.5s poller) and is deliberately conservative — a PIPELINE_
# TIMEOUT_S=600s age threshold — since a live process genuinely cannot tell
# "this run was abandoned by a dead process" apart from "this run is just
# slow" any other way. That mechanism IS real and DOES already fire
# server-side (confirmed by reading get_pipeline_status directly — the
# "Processing stalled...Safe to retry" message a prior investigation
# attributed to a purely client-side timer is actually written by THIS
# server-side self-heal, evidenced by its exact text matching and by a
# real incident log line in the pipeline's own `log` array timestamped
# exactly PIPELINE_TIMEOUT_S after that run's startedAt). But it is LAZY:
# it only runs when a client happens to poll, and only once the full 600s
# has elapsed since the run's OWN startedAt — a run orphaned by a restart
# late in its lifetime (or one nobody polls for a while) can sit
# unreconciled for most of that window even though the server itself has
# been back up and fully healthy the whole time.
#
# This function closes that gap differently: it runs exactly ONCE, at
# process startup. No age threshold is needed or appropriate here — unlike
# the in-process check above, a FRESH process's boot has, by definition, no
# live asyncio task associated with any pre-existing "running" pipeline
# document, no matter how recently that document's startedAt claims it
# began. If pipeline.state=="running" exists in Mongo at the exact moment
# this runs, the task that would ever have moved it out of "running" died
# with whatever process wrote it. So every such document is unconditionally
# reconciled immediately, cutting the worst-case reconciliation delay from
# "up to ~600s, and only if/when a client happens to poll" down to
# "however long this boot's own startup phase takes" (a few seconds, per
# this app's own boot log).
#
# No storage cleanup is needed here (verified by reading every stage this
# could interrupt, not assumed): media_check/audio_extraction/
# speech_recognition only ever hold already-uploaded media in a local
# Python bytes variable and local ffmpeg temp files (already removed in
# `finally` blocks in video_render_tools.py on every code path, success or
# failure); the first stage that writes anything durable at all
# (synchronization) only ever writes a Mongo document via sync_studio_
# tools.apply_alignment_result, never a new R2/GridFS object. A restart
# mid-run therefore never leaves a partial storage object behind to
# release — only this Mongo pipeline-state field, which is exactly what
# this function reconciles.

# 2026-09 stuck-pipeline incident (vid_bb7134374575431b, ~250MB upload
# wedged indefinitely at "Media validation"). CONFIRMED root cause, via
# code reading + empirical reproduction against this project's actual
# installed httpx and Python 3.14 interpreter (not assumed):
#
#   1. httpx's `read` timeout (the 300.0 below) bounds the gap BETWEEN
#      successive received chunks, never the TOTAL transfer time.
#      Reproduced directly: a request receiving a trickle of data every
#      <read-timeout>s succeeds no matter how long the WHOLE transfer
#      takes. A slow-but-technically-progressing ~250MB R2 fetch can
#      therefore run for many minutes without httpx itself ever raising.
#   2. The GridFS branch has NO timeout of its own at all — and
#      server.py's shared AsyncIOMotorClient sets no socketTimeoutMS
#      (confirmed by reading its construction), so a stalled socket read
#      there can also run unbounded.
#   3. The pipeline's own asyncio.wait_for(_run_stages(), timeout=
#      PIPELINE_TIMEOUT_S) watchdog DOES still correctly bound the whole
#      run even against a genuinely-blocking underlying call — verified
#      empirically (asyncio.wait_for raised TimeoutError to the caller
#      within the configured window even when the wrapped work was a
#      real, uninterruptible blocking call dispatched to a thread) — so
#      this was never a case of "stuck forever with the watchdog broken".
#      But it meant a stalled media fetch could silently consume nearly
#      the ENTIRE pipeline budget with zero diagnostic signal about which
#      operation actually stalled, starving every later stage of the
#      time meant for Gemini transcription/analysis.
#
# Fix: a dedicated, tighter ceiling around the fetch itself — REUSING
# (not inventing) the same 300s figure already chosen for the httpx
# client below, now applied as a genuine TOTAL-time bound via
# asyncio.wait_for. A stalled fetch now fails fast, specifically, and
# honestly at 300s (half the pipeline's total budget) instead of
# silently eating the whole 600s with a generic "stalled I/O" message;
# a merely-slow-but-healthy transfer still completes normally.
