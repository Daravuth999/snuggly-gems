"""video_render_tools.py — server-side final-master rendering: physically
muxes the approved AI narration audio into the lesson's original video,
producing a real MP4 with an embedded audio stream (not a separate
browser-side overlay).

Deliberately isolated from video_narration_tools.py's orchestration (which
owns job-stage bookkeeping) — this module knows nothing about Mongo, jobs,
or lessons. It takes bytes in, returns bytes out, and raises RenderError
with a specific, honest code when the operation genuinely cannot succeed.

Environment reality check (verified against this repo, not assumed):
server.py's own `_generate_silence_bytes()` already documents that a
system `ffmpeg` binary is NOT guaranteed present on Render ("works without
ffmpeg on Render"). This module's answer to that: prefer a system `ffmpeg`
on PATH when one exists (`_resolve_ffmpeg`), and fall back to the
self-contained binary bundled by the `imageio-ffmpeg` PyPI package — the
same "pure-Python/self-contained wheel, no system libs" pattern this repo
already uses for reportlab/pymupdf (see requirements.txt). Verified
locally: `pip install imageio-ffmpeg` resolves and executes a real ffmpeg
7.1 binary with no system package manager involved — the same install
mechanism Render's standard Python buildpack already runs from
requirements.txt, so this works without a Dockerfile or apt step. Render's
actual build-time network access to PyPI was not independently confirmed
from here (see the delivery report). Either way, this module NEVER fakes
a successful render: if no ffmpeg can be resolved at all, it raises
RenderError("ffmpeg_unavailable", ...) instead of silently returning the
un-muxed source as if it were a real master.

    """Combines the approved AI narration audio with the lesson's original
    video into one final master. `treatment` controls what happens to the
    ORIGINAL audio track as a single whole — there is no source stem
    separation in this stack (see video_narration_tools.py's module
    docstring), so treatment is deliberately coarse and honest rather than
    pretending to selectively keep only "ambience" or only "music":

      "mute"     — original audio dropped entirely, narration is the only
                   audio (the exact behavior this function always had).
      "duck"     — original audio kept but lowered under the narration.
      "preserve" — original audio kept at near-full volume alongside the
                   narration (both audible — appropriate when the
                   original had no dialogue/narration worth removing).

    If the source has no audio stream at all, "duck"/"preserve" silently
    behave like "mute" (there is nothing to duck or preserve) — this is
    the correct, honest outcome, not a bug: ffmpeg's amix filter requires
    two real audio inputs.

    The video stream is always copied without re-encoding (`-c:v copy`) —
    visual quality/timing is untouched; only the audio stream changes, so
    existing word/sentence timings computed against the narration audio
    remain accurate against the output file.

    """Real, ffmpeg-decode-and-re-encode concatenation of MP3 segments into
    ONE valid stream with an accurate total duration.

    Root-cause fix for a real production defect: naive byte-level
    concatenation of independently-encoded MP3 segments (the previous
    implementation) is unsafe. Every segment that passes through this
    module's own `-c:a libmp3lame` calls (normalize_line_loudness,
    time_compress_clip) — and ElevenLabs' own returned audio — carries a
    Xing/LAME VBR header: a special first data frame declaring that
    SEGMENT's own frame count/duration. When segments are joined as raw
    bytes, that header from the FIRST segment survives untouched in the
    merged file, and both ffprobe and real media players may compute the
    stream's reported duration from that header alone rather than
    scanning every frame — so a multi-segment assembled narration track
    can report (and in some players genuinely stop advancing at) only the
    first segment's own duration, silently truncating everything after
    it. This is exactly the class of bug _strip_id3_tags' own docstring
    describes ("iOS AVFoundation stopping playback at the first
    segment's embedded duration") — ID3 tag stripping alone does not fix
    it, since a Xing header is a real MPEG audio frame, not an ID3 tag.

    Decoding and re-encoding through ffmpeg's concat filter (not the
    concat demuxer with `-c copy`, which would preserve the same
    per-segment headers unchanged) produces one clean stream with a
    single, correct header covering the true total duration.

    Falls back to the previous naive byte-concatenation only when ffmpeg
    is genuinely unavailable — never blocks narration assembly."""
