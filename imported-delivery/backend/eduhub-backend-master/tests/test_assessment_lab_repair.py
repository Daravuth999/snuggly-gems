"""tests/test_assessment_lab_repair.py — regression suite for the 2026-08
Assessment Lab surgical repair.

Covers the required regression cases from the repair specification:
perfect score, explicit blanks, Gemini false negative + teacher correction,
uncertain-mark resolution, question alignment (one unreadable question must
never shift its neighbors), multiple corrections, exact (fractional) award
through the wallet, duplicate-award idempotency, notification only after a
confirmed credit, needs_review never being a dead end, and preservation of
the original Gemini extraction as an immutable audit record.

Reuses the in-memory fakes from tests/test_assessment_tools.py — same
route-level harness, no second test infrastructure.
