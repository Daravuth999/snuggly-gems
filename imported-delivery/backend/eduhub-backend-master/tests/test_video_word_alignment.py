"""tests/test_video_word_alignment.py — real per-word alignment merge
(video_word_alignment.py), the Teleprompter karaoke structural-fix §1.

2026-09: ElevenLabs timing migration with a controlled Gemini rollback.
Covers: honest word-level merging (matched words get
real gemini-3.5-transcribe timing + a `measured: True` provenance flag,
never a fabricated confidence number; unmatched words keep Gemini
segmentation's own interpolation untouched), multi-speaker/silence/
off-script handling, the 30-minute word-timestamp duration limit,
provider-failure resilience (never blocks the pipeline),
GeminiWordTimestampProvider's real request/response shape against the
Interactions API (verified live against Gemini's own docs AND against a
real live API call with a real key — see this round's report; exercised
here with an injected fake HTTP client so the suite itself makes no network
call), and the architectural guarantee that the alignment provider is
reachable ONLY from the authoring-time pipeline, never from any playback
path — proven two ways: a call-count spy through the real pipeline run, and
a static import-boundary check that can never regress silently.
