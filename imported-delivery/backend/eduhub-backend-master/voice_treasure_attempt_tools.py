"""voice_treasure_attempt_tools.py
==================================
Voice Treasure — Core Game milestone: mission image, recorder submission,
multimodal evaluation, attempt persistence + ownership + result recovery.

Isolated. Imports only own VT modules + the Gemini adapter. No reward payout,
no chest, no collection/progress (later milestones). GAS untouched here —
playing requires an already-PAID entry (state `succeeded`) created by
voice_treasure_entry_tools.

Privacy: raw audio is validated, sent to the evaluator, and DISCARDED. It is
never persisted, never written to R2, never logged, never put in localStorage.
Only the normalized evaluation result is stored.

Routes
------
  GET  /api/voice-treasure/mission/{mission_id}/image   (student, fallback img)
  POST /api/voice-treasure/submit-attempt               (student, multipart)
  GET  /api/voice-treasure/attempt/{attempt_id}         (student, ownership)
  GET  /api/admin/voice-treasure/attempts               (admin)
  GET  /api/admin/voice-treasure/attempts/{attempt_id}  (admin)

Attempt state machine
---------------------
  created → evaluating → evaluated
                       → evaluation_unavailable   (retryable; provider off)
                       → evaluation_failed          (retryable; provider error)
One attempt record per paid entry (_id = vt-attempt:{student_id}:{entry_id}).
Re-submission after a non-evaluated state is allowed (retry); a successful
`evaluated` attempt is returned as-is (idempotent, never re-charged/re-run).
