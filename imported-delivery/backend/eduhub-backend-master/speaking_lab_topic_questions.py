"""speaking_lab_topic_questions.py — Automated Topic-Based Question
Generation for Speaking Lab Group Mode.

ADDITIVE ONLY, isolated module — same convention as gemini_engine.py,
question_bank.py, lucky_draw.py. Does not touch _finalize_draw,
_weighted_pick, or anything else already documented as protected
elsewhere in this codebase.

WHY THIS EXISTS
───────────────
Group Mode's "Discussion Topic" has always been a plain string passed to
GroupDiscussionCard.jsx — historically a random pick from the flat static
question bank (db.speaking_lab_settings, "beginner"/"intermediate"
arrays; see the still-untouched /speaking-lab/questions routes). This
module lets a group instead CHOOSE a topic CATEGORY (Daily Routine,
Sports, ...) and get back a real, freshly-relevant discussion question —
with zero manual admin input, ever: no one tags questions by topic, no
one reviews output before a class hears it. That trade-off is deliberate
(see the build directive this module implements) — automated validation
checks SHAPE and SAFETY constraints, never "is this a good question."

ARCHITECTURE (mirrors gemini_engine.py's structure — the closer analog:
one-shot structured generation from a single input param, not the
multi-field coach_pack_shared.py shape):
  1. is_enabled() / generate_question(topic=...) — Gemini call, strict
     JSON schema validation, one retry on invalid JSON, same
     GEMINI_API_KEY / GEMINI_MODEL env vars gemini_engine.py already reads
     (no second Gemini client, no second env var).
  2. Collection `speaking_lab_topic_question_pool` — a small, dedicated
     pool of pre-generated, unconsumed questions per topic. Not modeled
     on experience_config_tools.py (that platform is for timed BANNER
     content, not a consumable pool) and not modeled on Mystery Box's
     claims collection as-is (that's one resolved prize per claim, a
     different shape) — closest in IDEMPOTENCY spirit only: an atomic
     find_one_and_update claims exactly one row, the same primitive
     mystery_box_tools.py uses for its own reservation decrement.
  3. claim_or_generate_question() — the three-tier fallback that makes
     "instant" hold even when Gemini is unavailable or the background
     refill hasn't caught up: atomic pool claim → inline on-demand
     generation → the existing static question bank (any question, since
     that bank has no topic concept).
  4. refill_pool() — background top-up, called from an external-cron-
     triggered HTTP endpoint (POST .../topic-questions/refill-due),
     following the EXACT auth pattern server.py's own
     POST /push/schedule/run-due already established
     (x-cron-secret header OR super-admin) rather than introducing a
     second scheduling mechanism or a second secret. No in-process
     scheduler (APScheduler or similar) exists anywhere in this backend
     and none is introduced here.

Registering the refill-due endpoint on an actual recurring schedule is a
hosting-platform cron-config change, outside this codebase's own commit —
see this module's own register function docstring and the build report.

You are EduHub's discussion-question generator for a Cambodian ESL \
speaking classroom (Speaking Lab, Group Mode).

You must output only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Do not include Markdown.
Do not include explanations.
Do not include comments.
Do not wrap JSON in code fences.

EduHub classroom philosophy:
The goal is spoken English fluency and real communication, not written
grammar drills or translation exercises. English must remain primary.

Audience:
- A small mixed-level group of Cambodian young English learners,
  discussing together — NOT a single beginner or a single intermediate
  student. One question must serve the WHOLE group at once.
- Phrase it simply enough that a beginner can attempt an answer, while
  leaving clear room for an intermediate student to elaborate further —
  do not write two separate questions or a beginner/intermediate split.
- Use short, natural, speakable English. Avoid difficult idioms.
- Keep it warm, classroom-safe, and age-appropriate for school students.
- Never touch sensitive, political, romantic, violent, or otherwise
  classroom-inappropriate subject matter.

Output:
- Exactly one clear, speakable English discussion question related to
  the given topic category.
- The question should invite a short spoken opinion, experience, or
  story — something a group can actually TALK about, not a single-word
  trivia answer.

Return only the JSON object. No preamble, no trailing text."""

    HOTFIX (observed in production): despite generationConfig's

    prepends a conversational preamble before the JSON object — e.g. the

    which failed json.loads on BOTH the original attempt and the retry
    (same failure, not a transient glitch — see this module's own retry
    logic). Since the model's own compliance isn't reliable here, the
    fix is at the parsing layer: after fence-stripping, if the string
    doesn't already start with "{", extract the substring between the
