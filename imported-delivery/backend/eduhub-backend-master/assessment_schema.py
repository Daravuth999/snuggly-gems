"""assessment_schema.py — AI Assessment / Quiz Submission Lab, canonical schema.

Pure, stdlib-only, no Mongo/network — same purity discipline as
sync_schema.py / video_scene_schema.py. Defines the document shapes shared
by every producer (Gemini extraction, teacher manual entry, teacher
correction) and every consumer (scoring engine, Author Studio review,
routes). Nothing in this module calls Gemini or touches a database — see
assessment_ai_provider.py for the Gemini boundary and assessment_tools.py
for the Mongo-backed routes.

Three documents:
  assessment           — a worksheet/quiz definition: title + ordered
                          questions, each with its own correct answer and
                          point value (spec: "no fake data" — every field
                          here is either teacher-supplied or Gemini-
                          extracted-then-teacher-reviewed, never invented).
  submission            — one student's attempt: a reference to the
                          uploaded media, the answers Gemini extracted from
                          it, and the resulting score. `status` is the
                          single source of truth for where a submission
                          sits in its lifecycle (see VALID_SUBMISSION_
                          STATUSES) — Author Studio and the student PWA
                          both render directly off this field, never a
                          derived/duplicated flag.
  award                 — a point-award reservation for one submission.
                          Kept as its OWN tiny document (not a field on
                          submission) so the unique index that makes
                          awarding idempotent (one award per submission)
                          is trivial to reason about — mirrors achievement_
                          tools.py's claim-document pattern.

Every `normalize_*` function is the one gate raw Gemini output passes
through before it is trusted: bounded lengths, whitelisted question ids,
clamped confidence — Gemini's own invented ids/ordering are never trusted
verbatim, matching video_scene_schema.py's normalize_* convention.
