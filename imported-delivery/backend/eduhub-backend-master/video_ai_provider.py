"""video_ai_provider.py — Gemini-primary AI engine for the Video Library.

Per explicit product direction (2026-06): Gemini is the PRIMARY AI engine
for this product — speech recognition AND educational analysis. This module
extends the existing Gemini REST integration pattern established by
voice_treasure_gemini.py (raw httpx against generativelanguage.googleapis.com,
GEMINI_API_KEY from env, strict-JSON prompts, normalize-at-the-boundary,
never raise into a route) rather than introducing a second AI ecosystem.

Provider neutrality is preserved: both providers here expose the SAME
duck-typed surface sync_provider.py established (`category`,
`provider_version`, async `align(media_bytes, content_type)` returning
`{"sync": <sync_schema.py canonical document>, "transcriptText": str}`), so
a future specialized ASR vendor can replace GeminiVideoProvider behind the
Universal Synchronization Engine without touching the Video Library.

Two providers:
  GeminiVideoProvider — real Gemini multimodal transcription (audio & video,
      inline for small files, Files API for large ones). Word-level timing
      is derived by length-weighted interpolation inside each Gemini
      sentence segment span — documented honestly in `provider_version`
      ("interp"), with word confidence.alignment left None (unknown), never
      fabricated as 1.0.
  MockVideoProvider — deterministic offline provider used automatically when
      GEMINI_API_KEY is absent (or VIDEO_AI_MOCK=1), so the complete
      pipeline is exercisable in any environment. Its output is clearly
      marked (`provider_version: "mock-asr-v1"`).

Educational analysis (`analyze_transcript`) follows the same pattern: real
Gemini when available, deterministic bounded mock otherwise.

Env:
  GEMINI_API_KEY       — provider key (absent ⇒ mock mode)
  VIDEO_AI_MODEL       — generateContent model for FAST paths: speech
                         recognition (align) and text-only educational
                         analysis (default: gemini-2.5-flash)
  VIDEO_ANALYSIS_MODEL — generateContent model for the DEEP whole-video
                         story/scene understanding path only (analyze_story
                         / analyze_story_raw — default: gemini-3.1-pro)
  VIDEO_AI_MOCK        — "1"/"true" forces mock mode even with a key (testing)

Two deliberately separate model configurations (2026-08 product direction):
speech recognition needs to be fast and cheap (it runs on every upload,
often on long media) — Flash. Whole-story scene/character/emotion
understanding is a single per-lesson call that directly drives narration
performance quality, so it warrants the stronger model. This ONLY affects
this module (video_pipeline_tools.py / video_narration_tools.py are its
only importers — verified, not assumed) via a video-library-specific env
var; it shares no configuration with GEMINI_MODEL, which is what every
OTHER EduHub Gemini integration (Book Factory, EduTalk, the AI Assistant,
premium_ai_tools, etc.) reads independently. Changing either model
constant here cannot affect any of those other systems.

    Root-cause fix for a real karaoke defect: the ASR prompt instructs
    Gemini to return segments "in chronological order", but that is a
    REQUEST, not a guarantee — a multimodal transcription of a longer/
    complex video can genuinely come back with one segment out of order.
    Every downstream consumer (this function's own paragraph-boundary
    logic, and the frontend's syncConsumption.js binary search, which
    documents "`units` must be sorted ascending by start" as a precondition
    it does not itself enforce) silently assumes chronological order. If
    Gemini violates it, the LAST array entry is not the chronologically
    last sentence, so build_paragraph/build_sentence's own "last item's end
    is the document's end" logic produces a document whose real final
    timestamp is wrong (too early) — which is exactly what made the
    student-facing karaoke highlight appear to "jump to the end" almost
    immediately: the frontend's own "have we reached the end" check
    (`timeSec >= last.end`) starts firing as soon as playback passes that
    one out-of-place segment's small end time, and never recovers for the
    rest of the video. Sorting by the segment's OWN reported start time
    here — once, at the single point every sync document is built from raw

# 2026-09 production incident (lesson vid_12473703734f4750, "Sealing the
# Deal"): despite _ASR_PROMPT explicitly instructing "start/end are SECONDS
# ... never clock strings" and generationConfig.responseMimeType being
# "application/json", Gemini emitted several segments with a BARE, UNQUOTED
# clock-notation value once the transcript passed the one-minute mark —
# e.g. `"start": 1:42.0,` instead of `"start": 102.0,` or even a quoted
# `"start": "1:42.0",`. A bare colon sitting in a JSON value position is a
# hard syntax error with no lenient fallback in Python's `json` module: the
# WHOLE payload fails to parse, discarding every segment (including the
# ones that were perfectly well-formed), not just the malformed one — this
# is what actually produced the misleading "no parsable segments" error
# while the raw response demonstrably contained real transcript content.
#
# parse_time_sec() below already correctly converts a QUOTED clock string
# ("1:42.0") to seconds — it was never the problem. The problem is purely
# that the malformed text never reaches it, because json.loads() rejects
# the surrounding document first. This regex targets exactly that: a bare
# numeric-clock-shaped token (one or two colons, optional decimal) sitting
# directly after a JSON `: ` in a value position, followed by a JSON
# delimiter. It is a no-op on well-formed JSON — ordinary decimal seconds
# ("12.4") contain no colon and never match, and an already-quoted string
# is untouched because the character right after "`: `" must be a digit,
# never a `"`.
