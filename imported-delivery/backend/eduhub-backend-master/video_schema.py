"""video_schema.py — Video Library, canonical lesson + purchase schema.

Pure, stdlib-only, no Mongo/network — same purity discipline as
sync_schema.py/book_factory_interaction_planner.py. Video Library is an
architecturally INDEPENDENT product from Books (per explicit product
direction): this module owns its own document shapes and never imports
from book_factory_*.py or server.py's book routes.

A video lesson's synchronized transcript/teleprompter data is NOT
duplicated here — it is a reference (`syncId`) into the EXISTING,
already-shipping Universal Synchronization Engine (sync_schema.py,
merged/production). Video Library reuses that schema exactly as Books
does; it does not fork or reimplement it. This module owns only what is
genuinely video-lesson-specific: title/thumbnail/pricing/publish metadata,
and the purchase/entitlement record.

Purchase state machine (mirrors voice_treasure_entry_tools.py's proven,
production state graph — the same shape, a new instance for this product):

    created -> initiating -> succeeded
                           -> failed     (retryable: new attempt = new state)
                           -> reconcile  (ambiguous GAS outcome, admin-only)

`succeeded` is the ONLY state that grants ownership. There is no
client-settable state — every transition happens inside
video_library_tools.py's atomic claim, never via a raw update from a route
payload.
